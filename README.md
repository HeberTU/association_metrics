# Association-Metrics

**Association-Metrics** is a Python module for measure the degree of association between variables built on top of SciPy and Numpy. and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project started due to the lack of reliable source code to calculate [Cramers'v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r's_V), and from that, we decided to package-up our development. 


## Installation

Association-Metrics requires:

* Python (>= 3.6)
* NumPy (>= 1.13.3)
* SciPy (>= 0.19.1)
* Pandas (>= 1.2.1)


## User installation
